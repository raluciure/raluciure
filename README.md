I am a final-year double degree Master's student at Aalto University, following a transformative first year at Universidad Politecnica de Madrid. My major is Human-Computer Interaction, which is complemented by a minor in Innovation and Entrepreneurship. My journey started with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, where I also gained practical experience as a front-end developer for one year. So, in summary, my academic journey revolves around enhancing user experiences with technology and discovering ways to develop innovative ideas and turn them into successful businesses. 



**I am actively seeking opportunities for my master's thesis or internships in areas closely aligned with front-end development, UI/UX design, or project management. My goal is to contribute my skills and expertise to projects that encompass these domains. I am highly motivated and eager to apply my knowledge and gain practical experience in the tech world, all while making a meaningful impact and further developing my career.**
